     </figure>

     <p>Known today as its Arabic names, el-Amarna or Tell-el-Amarna, Amarna was the capital city during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti in the New Kingdom. Amarna was built sometime during the 4th or 5th year of Pharaoh Akhenaten’s reign (1353-1336 BCE) and remained the capital of Egypt for 15-20 years until Akhenaten’s death when it was later moved to Memphis and then to Thebes by his successor, Tutankhamun (Originally Tutankhaten).</p>


     <p>During its habitation, Amarna was known then by its Egyptian name, Akhetaten, meaning “Horizon of Aten (or Aton)”. Aten was originally a minor deity with its name translated to light and represented with a sun disk hieroglyph (Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten.” Pyramids of Ancient Egypt: Bent Pyramid of Sneferu, Dashur). Amarna was built to worship Aten and Akhenaten chose to build his new capital in this location because he thought the site had never been used to worship any other god.</p>


     <p>Amarna is an exception to what archaeologists typically see of a site because Amarna was not substantially occupied before or after the time of the capital and it therefore does not have a lot of urban buildup as is typically seen with Ancient Egyptian sites. Therefore, Amarna offers a large array of urban landscape that has been continually excavated since the 19th century.</p>

     <h3>A Brief Look at Akhenaten’s Religion</h3>

</figure>

<p>The Aten was not a god that Akhenaten created rather, he was a minor deity associated with light and held various positions throughout the kingdoms. In the Old Kingdom, Aten was worshipped as an obscure aspect of the sun. During the Middle Kingdom, coffin texts represent Aten with a sun disk. In the story of Sinuhe, Pharaoh Amenemhat I is described as soaring into the sky and uniting with his creator, Aten (Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten.” Pyramids of Ancient Egypt: Bent Pyramid of Sneferu, Dashur). In the rest of the New Kingdom’s history (besides the reign of Akhenaten) the Aten was considered to be a part of the composite deity Ra-Amun-Horus where Ra represented the sun during the daytime, Amun represented the sun in the underworld at night, and Horus represented the sunrise (Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten.” Pyramids of Ancient Egypt: Bent Pyramid of Sneferu, Dashur).</p>


 <p>When Akhenaten became pharaoh, his name was originally Amenhotep IV (he changed it with his new religion so that it meant “he who is of service to the god Aten”). As pharaoh, he was responsible to maintain ma’at (harmony and balance) which he did for the first few years of his reign. When he decided to convert to Atenism, Akhenaten abolished the traditional Ancient Egyptian religion, closed temples and imposed his monotheistic view on the population. During this time Aten was considered the only god and unlike the previous gods, Aten had no human weaknesses and he was above human concerns. He simply existed and therefore, everything else existed. Even the population of Amarna did not practice this religion entirely. Archaeologists excavating at Amarna have found Bes (a dwarf that was believed to protect households) amulets and many other deities painted on pots and walls (Woolley, C. Leonard. “Excavations at Tell El-Amarna.” The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 8, No. ½). It was likely that the people also did not particularly take to the new religion because they were not allowed to communicate with Aten, only Akhenaten and his family could (Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten.” Pyramids of Ancient Egypt: Bent Pyramid of Sneferu, Dashur).</p>


  <p>Even though Akhenaten has been hailed as the first monotheist, he crippled the Egyptian economy because it heavily relied on temples and the religious revolution distracted the king from foreign affairs (Mark, Joshua J. “Amarna.” Ancient History Encyclopedia, Ancient History Encyclopedia)</p>

  <h3>Introduction to the Site Location</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<figure style="float: right; width: 30%; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

<figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Digital map of Egypt, by Delwen Samuel, accessed 14 November 2018." >Image 3</a> - "A digital map of Egypt showing the location of Amarna."</figcaption>

</figure>


<p>Amarna is a large desert bay that lies on the east side of the Nile river about halfway in between Memphis (present day Cairo) and Thebes (present day Luxor) in the province of el-Minia.</p>


<p>Amarna stretches about 7 km with borders to the east with steep limestone cliffs that rise about 100 meters with several wadis (a valley or ravine) placed throughout (Stevens, Anna. “The Archaeology of Amarna.”) that lead to a high desert (“News & Updates:” Boundary Stelae - Amarna The Place - Amarna Project).</p>


<p>The biggest wadis, the Great Wadi, has an indented profile that looks like it could represent the hieroglyph for the sun disk, or horizon, where the Aten was thought to dwell. This wadis may have also helped to influence Pharaoh Akhenaten’s choice on where to place his new capital (Stevens, Anna. “The Archaeology of Amarna.”, noted by Aldred, 1976).</p>


<p>To the south-east of Amarna, cliffs fall back to reveal a broad and flat valley that is about 3 km wide that begins above a low and irregular terrace-like edge that continues to the line of the cliffs.</p>

  <h3>Description of Site</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<figure style="float:middle; width: 75%; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

<img src="img/amarna06.png" width="100%" />

<figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Map of Amarna, Amarna Project, accessed 15 November 2018." >Image 4</a> - "A digital map of Amarna showing the layout of the city."</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>On the Northernmost point of the site is an area called the North City. The North City is a triangular space between the river and the lower slope approaching the cliff. Just south of the North City is the North Palace with the North Tombs just across from it cut into the cliffs. Also in the northern part of the city are desert alters and the North suburb. (Amarna Project)</p>


<p>The Central City and the Main City are in the center of the site right along the Nile River. The Central city is where the two main temples dedicated to Aten are along with the main State Palace and various administrative buildings. The main city is a large area dedicated to closely packed houses for the common people living at Amarna.  Also in the central part of the city but is halfway between the river and the cliffs are the Workmen's village and Stone Village. The Workmen’s Village (previously Eastern Village) was excavated in the 1970s-80s and consists of an isolated settlement tucked in a south facing valley and a wall surrounding it. The Stone Village gets its name from unworked limestone blocks scattered around the area and lies a 20 minute walk east from the Workmen’s Village and was probably used for residential houses or another workmen’s village. (Amarna Project)</p>


<p>At the southern area of the site lies kom el-Nana which was probably a temple built by Akhenaten and Maru-Aten which appears to have been a garden with shallow pools, gardens, and planted trees. To the east of these sites are the Southern Tombs which are carved into a plateau on the edge of the site. This tomb site is larger than the Northern tombs and contains 19 numbered tombs. (Amarna Project) Marking the southern border of Amarna are a series of border stelae that were carved with inscriptions of Amarna’s founding (Mark, Joshua J. “Amarna.” Ancient History Encyclopedia, Ancient History Encyclopedia).</p>

<h3>Excavations at Amarna</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<figure style="float: right; width: 35%; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

<img src="img/amarna05.png" width="100%" />

<figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Excavations at Amarna from The Amarna Project, Anna Stevens, accessed 15 November 2018." >Image 5</a> - "A neighborhood of mud-brick houses in the main city of Amarna."</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Because Amarna is an exceptional site, excavations have been ongoing since the 19th century to present time. In 1891-1892, Flinders Petrie and Howard Carter excavated the Central City and did some broader surveying. From 1907-1914 the DOG (Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft) excavated large areas of the housing complex located in the main city. Beginning in 1921 and ending in 1936, Excavations by the Egyptian Exploration Society worked in many of the main areas of the site. Present day excavations have been lead by Barry Kemp and have included survey, excavation, and restoration of many areas around the site including the Workmen’s Village.</p>


<p>In spring of 2017, fieldwork lead by Barry Kemp excavated a large pit-grave cemetery adjacent to the North Tombs. Excavations from 2015-2017 have revealed that this cemetery was for the labor force that maintained the city of Akhenaten and likely lived in the working villages of the Workmen’s Village or Stone Village. Almost all of the individuals buried in these graves were sub-adults between the age of 7 and 25 which is very unusual for an urban population grave at the time of the Amarna period. (Kemp, Barry. “Tell El-Amarna Spring, 2017.” The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology)</p>


<p>Even though Amarna has had ongoing excavations, early excavations had poor fieldwork methodologies, and interpretation and curation of archaeological materials and therefore, the areas that were excavated then, we have little knowledge about and have to consider them sterile because of little attempt to record the nature and stratigraphy of the deposits in the structural remains (Stevens, Anna. “The Archaeology of Amarna.”).</p>


<p>However poor the methodologies these early archaeologists had, they did find some awe-inspiring artifacts that show the unique culture the Amarna period had and how it differed from previous times. Arguably the most famous find from Amarna to date is the bust of Queen Nefertiti, the chief wife of King Akhenaten. Discovered in December 1912 by DOG under the direction of Ludwig Borchardt, an Egyptian worker found the remains of a structure that was soon to be known as the studio of the sculptor, Thutmose.The bust of Nefertiti was found inside and is made out gypsum, stucco, plaster, limestone, wax, and crystal and was nearly finished except for one of Nefertiti’s eyes. Because the bust was unfinished, it has been suggested that Thutmose had intended for it to be used as a 3D model for future portraits and sculptures of the queen (“Nefertiti's Bust.” Nefertiti's Bust, Ancient Egypt Online).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>Because of the relatively short period of time Amarna was occupied, it has given archaeologists and egyptologists a window of opportunity to see exactly what life was like during the late 18th dynasty without having to travel back in time. Along with his wife Nefertiti and children, King Akhenaten turned away from the old Egyptian traditions and gods and brought a new culture to the land, even though it was for a very brief amount of time. With continuing excavations of sites such as the cemeteries and the working villages, we will continue to find new evidence from this site and thus, gain new insights into this time of the Egyptian record.</p>
