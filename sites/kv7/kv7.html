		 <p>KV 7 is the original tomb of Ramesses II. This tomb was built in the 19th dynasty during Ramesses II reign. New attributes were used in the tomb from that of Seti I, his father, such as a decorative gate at the entrance as well as the first tomb in the Valley of the Kings to use an open entranceway.(1) However, it also utilized the older bent axis design. Ramesses II initially resided in this tomb upon his death, but his remains were removed in the 21st Dynasty because of tomb robberies that occurred in the 20th Dynasty according to the “Strike Papyrus”.(3) Ramesses II was initially moved to KV 17 and then to the secret royal cache in DB 320 at Dayr al Bahri.(2) Ramesses II mummy was found in 1881 during an excavation of Dayr al Bahri and his body was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero at Bulaq on June 3, 1886. Under the outer wrappings, there were hieroglyphics where the priests indicated the mummy’s rewrapping and reburial in KV17 and Deir el Bahri.(6) Ramesses II mummified remains currently reside and are on display in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Egypt.(4)</p>

     <p>KV 7 is located in the East Valley of the Kings in the northwest quadrant of that valley. It is also at a relatively low point in the valley and has been subjected to many floods throughout antiquity.(3) The part of the valley where KV 7 is located contains a weaker form of limestone in the valley and due to the flooding caused the limestone to swell and break causing cave-ins of the rock which makes excavation of the tomb fairly tedious at the very least.(3)</p>

     <p>KV 7, although built during the New Kingdom in the 19th Dynasty, went back to an older design of a bent axis, which means it was shaped like the letter “L” with many side chambers and rooms. This change in design was not for aesthetics though, it was a change in design to continue digging into limestone layers since the straight design would have taken it into “marly soil”.(1) It also is built at an angle where the tomb is embedded in the rock. Being one of the largest tombs in the Valley of the Kings, KV 7 has many chambers and rooms. Some of these chambers and rooms contains scenes that are painted and although the flooding destroyed areas of these wall paintings, archaeologists were able to estimate what was painted on the walls based on fragments of the paintings that allow for recreation of the scenes.(3,5)</p>

     <p>The following is a description of the wall paintings or recreations for each chamber or room that had wall paintings: The entrance and stair-ramp have a solar disc flanked by Isis and Nephtys and images of Maat; the first corridor and second stair-ramp contain scenes from the Litany of Ra. The second corridor contains scenes from Amduat; the main shaft has painted scenes of Ramesses II before various deities; the four-pillared hall contains and Osiris shrine and painted scenes from the Book of Gates; The third and fourth corridor has painted scenes from the 'opening of the mouse' ceremony; the antechamber to the burial chamber has painted scenes from the Book of the Dead; the burial chamber itself and the pillared halls on the side have painted scenes from the Book of Gates, the Amduat and the Book of the Divine Cow; and the side chambers contain images of Ramesses II with Isis and Nephtys and scenes from the Amduat.(3)</p>

     </figure>
     <p>Although the tomb has been unsealed since antiquity, multiple floods have severely damaged the tomb making excavation extremely difficult. The flooding debris, sediment and lack of technology made excavating the deeper chambers cumbersome. The tomb’s initial excavation ca. 1917 by Henry Salt was only a partial excavation due to the amount of debris and sediment in the tomb. The tomb was not fully excavated scientifically until 1993.

         <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>Ramesses II could not have picked a worse place for his tomb to be built. Its entrance and quality of the limestone shale in that area are indicative of his choice of location in the Valley of the Kings. It was fortunate that the priests were wise enough to move his remains in the 21st Dynasty to a safer location because of the looting because if it weren’t for the looting, the floods would have possibly destroyed any tangible evidence of Ramesses II mummy. This would have been a tragedy as he was regarded as one of greatest pharaohs of his time. His impact on antiquity in Egypt as the “builder king” brings many well preserved monuments from his reign such as the Ramasseum and Abu Simbel into modern times; allowing us a glimpse into the past that was ancient Egypt.(4)</p>
