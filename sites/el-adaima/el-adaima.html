     <p>The Ancient Egyptian site of el-Adaima is located along the west side of the Nile River. This particular site was inhabited from approximately 3700-2600 BC (Breand, 2). Adaima was discovered in 1908 by Jacques de Morgan, a French archaeologist. After Morgan finished with his excavations it was abandoned, and then later rediscovered by a man named Ferdinand Debono. Once Debono had finished at the site, Adaima was left alone again and it was not excavated again until 1989. A woman named Beatrix Midant-Reynes headed the project. This period of excavation produced the largest amount of information, knowledge, and hard data. It was by far the most thorough and well-documented of the three excavations. The site informed archaeologists and anthropologists about mortuary practices, burial rituals, Egyptian prehistory, and daily life just to name a few. The site has not been excavated again since Midant-Reynes finished there in 2005. Unfortunately, much of the site is in ruins from being plundered over the centuries, and some of the earlier excavations.</p>

    <h3>Location, Geography, Setting</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

     <p>Adaima is located on the West bank of the Nile River. Its relative location is between the modern day city of Esna and Hierakonpolis. The entirety of the site, including both cemeteries, stretches on for four hectares - approximately 9.88 acres (Breand, 50).</p>

    <p>The prehistoric site of Adaima did not go on to become a thriving metropolis. Instead, it is presumed that the inhabitants moved outwards and toward towns that were beginning to grow and become large cities. Thus, today Adaima sits quietly and virtually uninhabited.</p>

     <p>The latitude and longitude of el-Adaima is as follows (in decimal degrees): 25.235833, 32.593611</p>

     <p>The site of el-Adaima is divided into three different sections: the Western Cemetery, Eastern Cemetery, and settlement.</p>

     <p>The Western Cemetery had very few intact graves. These burials were badly plundered, and it is estimated to have happened during the Predynastic Period (Midant-Reynes, 238).</p>

     <p>The Eastern Cemetery is divided into two sections which are simply referred to as north and south. In total, 580 burials were excavated from the Eastern Cemetery alone (Breand, 52). This burial ground was filled with mostly children’s graves. The north was filled with adults and children but was still predominately children. The tombs of the children varied greatly. According to archaeologist Gaelle Breand, “To the south, there are only children’s graves (in baskets, coffins, simple pits dug in the sand, or in ceramic jars) dating from the Naqada IID-IIIA2 (IIIB-C1) period” (Breand, 52).</p>

     <p>The settlement envelopes the rest of el-Adaima. “The site represents the settlement of a small community without marked social differentiation.” (Breand, 51).</p>

     <p>Adaima was discovered by Jacques de Morgan in 1908. He was a French archaeologist who happened to be working in the area at the time of his grand discovery. Excavations of the site began shortly thereafter. There is not a lot of specific information about his findings, or even the excavation in general.</p>

     <p>After Morgan, the site was left abandoned until it was rediscovered by Ferdinand Debono in 1973 (Patch, 2011). Debono then began his own excavations into 30 different tombs. All of these gravesites were badly plundered by the time of his excavations, and nowadays, unfortunately, this section of the cemetery is completely destroyed.</p>

    <p>Once again, Adaima was left deserted after being excavated and it was not excavated again until 1989 (Breand, 50). A woman named Beatrix Midant-Reynes headed the project. This period of excavation produced the largest amount of information, knowledge, and hard data. It was by far the most thorough and well-documented of the three excavations. Midant-Reynes excavated both of the cemeteries within Adaima. She also made sure to process and excavate the settlement as well. Midant-Reynes’s team worked for years to collect and preserve all that they could out of this prehistoric site.</p>

    <p>Midant-Reynes and her team catalogued and preserved a large number of pottery from the site. Pottery was present in the settlement as well as in the tombs in the form of grave goods (Midant-Reynes, 238). In fact, more vessels came from the graves than from the settlement. They also made sure to take notes on the markings on the pottery, which would prove to be very useful later on.</p>

    <p>The workers on this excavation made sure to take detailed notes of the settlement and what they found. For example, Midant-Reynes wrote about the finding of small mudholes throughout the settlement (Midant-Reynes, 238). She documented the size and shape of each one in order to carefully analyze them and then hopefully determine their purpose. She paid a lot of attention to even the smallest details.</p>

    <p>All in all, Mitant-Reynes's 16 year excavation of the site would end up revealing interesting and historically useful information about the people of Adaima.</p>
    <h3>Results of Excavations</h3>

<p>The excavations of el-Adaima has resulted in the collection of valuable information (and artifacts) about the prehistory of Ancient Egypt. For example, during the most recent excavation (1989-2005) archaeologists and anthropologists working on site discovered a few cases of infectious diseases (Midant-Reynes, 239). This was an important find because it gives us knowledge about possible causes of death during the time period. It also allows for interpretation and analysis of these diseases, how they came about and were contracted, how they may have spread, and how they would have affected the people of Adaima.</p>

<p>Another significant result of the excavation has to do with the many pots that were found in Adaima. Special attention was placed on these artifacts. Pottery is a great find at any excavation because it may lead to a plethora of information about the site. For instance, there was no writing found in Adaima (it is a prehistoric site, so this was not surprising) and so the pots were used in place of writing. Archaeologists dated the site based on the different markings found on the pots and their relative likeness to other marks found on pottery in other Egyptian sites. It may sound complicated, but it is a form of relative dating that is used quite frequently. Through the pots it was determined that the site had been active and inhabited from roughly 3700-2600 BC.</p>

<p>It should also be mentioned that the pots at Adaima were important for more than just relative dating purposes. A number of the pots found in the southern section of the Eastern Cemetery contained the remains of infants and small children (McGeorge). This burial practice was not necessarily uncommon, but it is still important because it shows how important the afterlife was to the people of Adaima. They took their time, energy, and money to give a proper burial to those who died, presumably to make their journey into the afterlife an easy and pleasant experience. It could also be inferred that the tucking of an infant into a pot could also symbolize a form of rebirth (passing on into eternity). When looking at photos of the infants curled up inside the pieces of pottery, they almost look like a fetus in a womb, hence the rebirth theory.</p>

<p>The above mentioned results are only a few from the excavation of el-Adaima. There were many many more. Theories were developed about why Adaima dimished as a settlement, and where its inhabitants went (presumably to emerging city centers). The diets and food sources of the people were evaluated. Burial rituals were examined. These onyl name a few of the many outcomes of the excavations of Adaima.

     <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Overall, the site of el-Adaima was an important archaeological find. According to Egyptologist Beatrix Midant-Reynes, “The multi-component character of Adaima, with its functionally specific activity areas and its domestic units give it a special importance as a site to collect data on Egyptian prehistory, palaeo-environment and subsistence strategy.” (Midant-Reynes, 239). Its uniqueness in being a site with a settlement and gravesite that was used simultaneously was important because it allowed for interesting comparisons to be made. Archaeologists could compare information from the settlement to the cemetery and analyze components such as social status, wealth, and religious beliefs.</p>

<p>The pottery found in Adaima was also important because it was able to be identified the time period that el-Adaima was functioning. This meant that historians, archaeologists, and other researchers would now have more artifacts and information to refer to when attempting to do relative dating on other Ancient Egyptian sites that may be found in the future.</p>

<p>It is a shame that so much of the site was damaged and plundered. However, archaeologists, anthropologists, and Egyptologists were still able to find enough artifacts and information to learn about the people who once lived in this Ancient Egyptian site.</p>
