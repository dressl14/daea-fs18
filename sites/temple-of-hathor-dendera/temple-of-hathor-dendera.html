		 <p style="text-indent: 40px" >The Temple of Hathor, Dendera dates back to the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. As its namesake suggests, this temple is dedicated to the goddess Hathor. It is located within the modern-day city Qena, just south of the Nile River. This site is a complex of structures, but within my own research, I will only be focusing on the Temple of Hathor, which is the largest structure within the complex. Past and recent excavations of this structure have led to intriguing discoveries and has allowed for a better understanding of this Temple. An important element of this temple is that the surrounding structures, along with the Temple of Hathor, has been modified for various reasons since it was first constructed.</p>

     <h3>The Goddess Hathor</h3>

    </figure>

     <p style="text-indent: 40px" >The goddess Hathor was an important deity to the Egyptians, one of the most important deities in fact. She was the Egyptian goddess of the sky, love, motherhood, joy, dance, as well as foreign lands. Hathor’s origin story, though, began with a blood lust that could not be quenched. The myth states that Hathor (known as Sekhmet at this time) was released by Ra upon the humans to answer for their sins, Ra was quite displeased with how ungrateful the humans were. Other gods began to beg Ra for compassion for the humans, as there would be no humans left on earth to be worshipped by if this blood lust continued. Ra then tricked Sekhmet into drinking a blood red beer to knock her into slumber; she woke up in a state of compassion and became the goddess we now recognize her as. Hathor is included in various other myths as well, her presence within the Ancient Egyptian state was quite large, as each of her roles within different tales are unique. She is the daughter of Ra according to some stories, since he “created” her, but other tales would consider her as his mother or wife. Commonly, though, the goddess Hathor is known as Horus’ consort. Yearly, these two deities would be reunited through a special religious event which included the statue of Hathor that stood within the Temple of Hathor. During the period of the lowest water levels of the Nile River, Egyptians would transfer the statue of Hathor upstream to the Temple of Horus in Edfu-Behedet to reunite the goddess Hathor with the god Horus. Edfu and Dendera are considered sister-cities because of this religious event which is known as the “Feast of the Beautiful Reunion (Marouard, 2016).” All of these stories mark the goddess Hathor as a truly remarkable deity that the Egyptian held to a high standard.</p>

     <p style="text-indent: 40px" >It is commonly known that Egyptian deities are depicted as animals. These animals usually share a common trait with the deity it represents. Hathor’s animal counterpart is a cow. She is usually depicted with a body of a modern human, but with the head of a cow. Her motherly compassion has helped shaped this depiction. Another myth, that references Hathor as the “Goddess of the Sky,” says her four legs represents four pillars that hold up the sky. Her identifying feature would be her headdress. This headdress consists of two horns facing outwards with a sun-disc in-between the horns. Her horns represent her animal spirit: Bovines. While the sun disc is said to represent her title as the sky goddess (Seawright, 2002). The sun disc is also called the “Eye of Ra,” which was given to Hathor by the sun god.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px"  >The location of the Temple of Hathor is within Dendera, Egypt which is located in Upper Egypt. This ancient city is now known as todays Qena, Egypt. Dendera was the capital of the sixth Nome of Upper Egypt, Iqer. Dendera is also locate right off of the Nile River by a few miles, making the trek for the “Feast of the Beautiful Reunion” quite convenient.</p>

    </figure>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px"  >The temple of Hathor is one of the best-preserved temples in Egypt (Marouard, 2016). Within this site there are many structures, but the largest is the Temple of Hathor. This temple consists of many chambers, few being: cult chambers for Hathor as well as other gods and goddesses, crypts, a treasury, and multiple other chambers as you can see in Image 3. The Hypostyle Halls contain tall columns that contain the head of Hathor at the top of the column. The rest of the columns are enclosed in hieroglyphs, as shown in Image 4. As you can see within Image 4, this temple was quite colorful in its time- which makes this temple stand out as one of most well preserved in Egypt. Within a cult chamber, a circular map of the stars is carved into the ceiling of the temple. This map is known as a representation of the ancient Egyptian solar sky. This map is now known as the Dendera Zodiac. The circular map is being held by four women with the help of Falcon-headed people. Within the map are depictions of the signs of the zodiac. A few of these ancient zodiac signs can be recognized as zodiac signs that are used today, a few being: Aries, Taurus, Scorpio, and Capricorn. Surrounding the signs are, “thirty-six spirits that symbolize the 360 days of the Egyptian year. This piece of Egyptian history is an important aspect of the Temple of Hathor in Dendera. While this piece obviously originated within Egypt, it is now being housed in the Musée du Louvre’s Egyptian gallery. This is a huge issue in Egyptian Archaeology because Egypt is currently in the process of requesting the return of all unethically obtained artifacts. The Dendera Zodiac is said to have been excavated and given to France without explicit permission from Egyptian government. </p>

    <h3>Excavations</h3>
   <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

   <p style="text-indent: 40px"  >In 1821, the Dendera Zodiac arrived on France soil. This excavation was headed by Sebastien Louis Saulnier, who was appointed by, “Jean-Baptiste Lelorrain to remove the Zodiac ‘from the ceiling of the temple and ship it to France” (Roche, 2011). This removal was not your typical excavation operation. Sebastien used gunpowder to blow holes throughout the ceiling around the Dendera Zodiac, releasing it from its confines. The Egyptian ruler of the time, Mohamed Ali Pasha, “sold the Dendera Zodiac to King Louis XVIII for 150,000 francs” (Roche, 2011). King Louis added this artifact to his cabinet of collections, the Dendera Zodiac was later donated to the Musée du Louvre’s Egyptian gallery in 1907, where it is still displayed today. While I could not find much on the excavations of the Temple of Hathor, what I did find of the excavation of the Dendera Zodiac is an important part of the history of this temple.  </p>

   <h3>Significance of Excavations</h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

   <p style="text-indent: 40px"  >This questionable excavation is important to today’s ethical view point of archaeological excavations. Today’s excavations have to follow very detailed, thought out plans. These plans also require permissions from the ruling government, where ever the excavation is taking place as well as the local governing body and community since the excavation will most likely be affecting their home. Egypt has had a past full of questionable excavations because of its rich history. Other Egyptian artifacts that had questionable excavations are also being requested back to Egypt, but many countries have denied the requests due to different circumstances, making the Egyptian antiquities department scramble for different approaches. </p>

   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

   <p style="text-indent: 40px"  >The Temple of Dendera is a unique structure built into an ancient city. Many Festivals took place here including the “feast of the Beautiful Reunion” which comprised a trek up the Nile River to Dendera’s sister city Edfu. This Temple is a good example of the questioning of ethical excavations as it has been under investigation for the return of its missing artifact. This site is a good example, over all, for how Egyptian Archaeology has been treated throughout the past few centuries. The Egyptian state has been missing important parts of its history do to being under the rule of other countries and those countries allowing the removal of important historical artifacts for their own benefit.  </p>
