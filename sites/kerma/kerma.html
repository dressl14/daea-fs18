     <p>Kerma was once the capital of the Kushite Kingdom, a state that rivaled Egypt and flourished between 2500BC and 1500BC. Located in Upper Nubia, now Northern Sudan, Kerma was a major economic and political center that competed with Egypt for control of trade in the Nile Valley. It’s important to note that the Kerma Civilization was a complex society that was distinctly different from the Egyptians and developed independently (Schrader 2015). Their relationship with Egypt was one of war and trade, but the extent of Egyptian influence is still a point of debate. The archaeological site at Kerma is one of the largest Nubian sites and is most well-known for its burials and architecture, specifically massive mud-brick constructions called deffufas. Excavations of this site began in the early 20th century, most famously by Egyptologist George Reiser (Bonnet 2017).</p>

   <p>Kerma was located just south of the Nile’s Third Cataract within the Kushite Kingdom, which at one point extended from the First Cataract to the Fifth Cataract. This location was a strategic advantage and allowed Kerma to develop as a prominent trading post. Given their control of the gold mines of Upper Nubia, Kerma often traded gold, exotic animals, ebony, and other luxuries (Judd and Irish 2009). The Dongola Reach between the Third and Fourth Cataracts, where Kerm is located, is among the most fertile regions along the Middle Nile. This lead to a higher concentration of people in this area than along other parts of the Middle Nile, leading to the rise of Kerma as a prosperous city. During this time, the savannah of Central Sudan extended further north into the present day dry desserts in the Dongola Reach. The bushes and seasonal grasslands of the savannah could also support pastoralists with herds of cattle, sheep and goats leading to more trade (Hafsaas-Tsakos 2009).Kerma was located just south of the Nile’s Third Cataract within the Kushite Kingdom, which at one point extended from the First Cataract to the Fifth Cataract. This location was a strategic advantage and allowed Kerma to develop as a prominent trading post. Given their control of the gold mines of Upper Nubia, Kerma often traded gold, exotic animals, ebony, and other luxuries (Judd and Irish 2009). This area was also very fertile, like much of the Nile Valley Region, and their society was largely based on agriculture.</p>

        <h3>Site Description</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

     <p>The site at Kerma consists on a necropolis and an urban center. The main feature of the city is the Western Deffufa, a large mud-brick structure that is still standing despite a ton of erosion from the wind and dry air. The building has been interpreted as a temple and is isolated from the rest of the town. The town has several other structures such as chapels, houses, workshop, stores, ect. The necropolis consists of inhabitants of the urban areas. The city is surrounded by large ditches are walls that suggest that they were trying to protect themselves from outsides forces, perhaps Egypt (Bonnet 2017; Hafsaas-Tsakos 2009).</p>

      <p>The first excavations near Kerma were conducted by George Reisner between 1913 and 1916. These sites were identified as an urban settlement along the east bank of the Nile and a large burial ground with more than 20,000 burials further east (Hafsaas-Tsakos 2009). During his excavations, he found around 1000 bodies and 5000 artifacts. Reisner’s excavations were interpreted within the contemporary colonial framework, which led him to suggest that Kerma was a trading post governed by Egyptians, a perception that is challenged today. He came to this conclusion due to the excessive amount of Egyptian-like artifacts found in undisturbed burials.  Signs of significant social stratification are evident in these burials. Large structures, like deffufas, are interpreted as temples and Reisner believed one to be the tomb of a king. Mud-brick structures appear relatively early in the history of Kerma and the layout of the city is very unorganized, this can be seen in the archaeological record (Bonnet 2017).

      <p>French archaeologist B. Gratien excavated the Kerma necropolis of Sai, about 100 km to the north in the 1970s and was able to distinguish four phases in the development of the Kerma civilization based on pottery, funerary ritual, and tomb morphology evolution. Further studies contributed knowledge of the Lower Nubian ‘Group C’ culture between Egypt and Kerma (Bonnet 2017). Since 1976, the University of Geneva has resumed excavations at Kerma under Charles Bonnet. The archaeologists have revealed remains from the extensive urban settlement that show visible outlines of the many mud brick buildings. They have uncovered 350 tombs, in addition to the 3000 graves dug by Reisner. The new investigations have added data that change our perceptions of the Kerma people as established by Reisner (Hafsaas-Tsakos 2009).</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

      <p>The site at Kerma is rich in archaeological material and continues to provide valuable insight into the Kingdom of Kush and the interaction between the Nubians and Egyptians. A reanalysis of past interpretations of this site have given us a deeper understanding of social inequality, funerary customs, national identity, and ideas of race. With ongoing excavations still occurring, there is still so much to learn about the relationship between Ancient Egypt and Kush. Although there are many burials, and some remnants of architecture, the archaeological record has been limited and is being threatened every day by the desert with make these excavations all the more important to the larger archaeological record. </p>
