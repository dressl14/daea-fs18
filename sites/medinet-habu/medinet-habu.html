      <h1>Medinet Habu</h1>
      <h3>New Kingdom: 20th Dynasty (1184-1153 BCE)</h3>
	  <h4>Alaynna Dressler</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>The great temple complex found at Medinet Habu, known as Djanet by the ancient Egyptians, was a royal mortuary temple dedicated to Ramesses III, who is believed to have held the throne between 1186 BC and 1155 BC. He ushered Egypt into a time of prosperity and wealth while defending the country and its people from numerous foreign invasions. However, as his reign came to an end, the power that Egypt had held for thousands years began to weaken. The nation-state was left with extensive political and economic issues, as well as occupations by the Nubians, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. Ramesses III was eventually assassinated in a coup thought to have been organized by one of his wives in an effort to put her son on the throne. CT scans of his mummy, which had not been buried at Medinet Habu, revealed that he suffered a fatal knife wound to the throat.</p>
<p>Today, Medinet Habu serves as one of the most informative and best preserved traditional mortuary temples constructed during the New Kingdom. The temple itself may be the part of this site that inspires the most curiosity, but archaeologists have discovered many other features that give insight into how Medinet Habu might have functioned in its prime. Found at the site are administrative quarters and places for grain storage, as well as a wall that has been dubbed the “Inner Inclosure Wall” (Hölscher, 1941). There are also a few different archaeological components of this site thought to range from the eighteenth dynasty to the Coptic period (Hölscher, 1939). These components will be addressed in detail later in this site report. </p>


     <h3>Regional and Geographical Setting</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>Medinet Habu is located on the West Bank of the Nile River across from the modern city of Luxor. It is situated near the Theban Hills in the western desert. For geographical reference, the site is approximately four miles away from the Valley of the Kings and around four hundred miles south of Cairo. During the time of the ancient Egyptians, this city was known as Thebes and was an incredibly important religious destination during the New Kingdom.</p>

    </figure>
<p>Thebes was the capital of Egypt in parts of the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. After the pharaoh Akhenaten took power, the capital moved to Amarna and continued to be moved every time a new pharaoh took power. While it was no longer the political capital, the priests of Amun made Thebes their center of power. There, they governed and influenced religious life in Egypt from the temples of Karnak and Luxor (Mark, 2016). The city itself was located along the east bank of the Nile River while the necropolis district was located along the west bank. Ramesses III’s temple is one in a series of mortuary temples/structures in this area of the western desert. The ancient Egyptians believed that the area west of the Nile was the “land of the dead” because it was barren and home to the dying sun. Burying the dead in the west gave individuals the opportunity to be reborn in the Duat, the Egyptian underworld, just as the sun was reborn every day in the eastern sky. It makes sense that pharaohs and other important figures would choose to build their tombs/temples here because it would bring them closer to the afterlife.
</p>

     <h3>Description of the Site</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

     <p>The mortuary temple of Ramesses III is situated inside of the largest structure at the site. The complex is about 700 ft by 1,000 ft and is covered extensively in hieroglyphics and other reliefs (El Abd, 2012). The layout and iconographic systems of Ramesses III’s temple are very similar to what has been associated with the Ramesseum, but are hardly as elegant. To the south of the temple is what remains of an extensive royal palace, containing a public area where the pharaoh would have gone to be viewed by his subjects. Unfortunately, stone foundations and a few standing doorways are all that remains of this structure. The rear halls of the larger temple have also not survived the ages. The tops of the columns that held up the ceiling are gone, as is the ceiling itself. The walls have also disappeared, leaving behind foundations where they once stood. Miraculously, the temples, outer walls, and two courtyards at the front of the structure are well-preserved and are covered in detailed reliefs and hieroglyphics (Hölscher & Nelson, 1929). It is estimated that the temple contains around 75,350 sq ft of decorated wall reliefs (Murnane, 1980).  According to Harold Nelson, the archaeologist who completed the epigraphic survey of Medinet Habu between 1924 and 1928,
     </p>
<blockquote>“... on the outside of the temple and in the two great courts, were carved the records of the king’s public achievements --
  his wars, his deeds of prowess in the hunt, and his part in the great state festivals. The remaining portions of the
  building show the monarch in the performance of his religious duties, participating in the various acts of the temple service” (Hölscher & Nelson, 1929).</blockquote>

</figure>
<p>Many of these reliefs also depict Egyptian gods and goddesses interacting with people, the land, and the pharaoh Ramesses III. Deities like Ra, Osiris, and Isis make numerous appearances throughout the site, but one of the most prominent figures is that of the goddess Hathor. She had a variety of different roles in Egyptian society and was probably one of the most (if not the most) important goddess in ancient Egypt. There were also a few reliefs that showed the figure of Amenirdis I, a deified queen and high priestess who was buried at Medinet Habu upon her death.</p>
<p>The god Amun is the figure that appears most often in the context of Medinet Habu. There are a significant amount of reliefs upon the temple walls that depict Ramesses III making offerings and bowing in submission to him. Medinet Habu’s original name was “House-of Millions-of-Years of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: ‘Userma’re’-Meriamon, Possessed of Eternity,’ in the Estate of Amon on the West of Thebes” (Hölscher, 1941). On the external southern wall of the temple, there is also an inscription in which Ramses III addresses Amun and dedicates this temple to his glory:</p>

(Hölscher, 1941)</blockquote>

</figure>
<p>Directly to the east of the main temple are the Chapels of the Divine Adoratrices, also known as the Chapels of the Gods Wives. These structures are tiny in comparison to the main temple, but they are packed full of religious iconography. Again, we see Amun as the chief figure and there is a reason for that. These chapels were specifically dedicated to the deceased “wives” of Amun. They were what we would consider to be high priestesses, but the Egyptians believed them to be directly tied to Amun by a divine bond similar to marriage. As such, these women held tremendous power in ancient Egyptian society, often serving as a mediator between Amun and the pharaoh himself (Ayad, 2009). The tomb of one of these priestesses can be found at Medinet Habu. Directly next door to the chapels is a small mortuary structure holding the tomb of Amenirdis I, a Kushite princess, deified queen, and high priestess of Amun. As far as archaeologists are concerned, she is the only “wife of Amun” to be buried at this site. There are also a few smaller features to be found at Medinet Habu, including a sacred lake in the northeastern corner and a nilometer to the west of that.
</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are several different archaeological components that have been found at Medinet Habu. In the 18th dynasty, Hatshepsut and Thutmose III built a small temple dedicated to the god Amun at the site. In the 20th dynasty, Ramesses III chose to build his mortuary temple around this feature as a way to honor Amun, as well as himself. Medinet Habu remained relatively undisturbed until the Romans arrived in Egypt. They ushered in a new time now known as the Coptic period. It was a time of destruction, religious turmoil, and political upheaval. Medinet Habu, once a symbol of the greatness of Amun, was turned into a Christian monastery. As a result, certain places within the temple have been wholy damaged and are irreparable (Hölscher & Nelson, 1929). The Romans also built a large courtyard at the entrance of the 18th dynasty temple to Amun. This courtyard is the easternmost part of the Medinet Habu complex discovered to date. </p>

     <h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>During Napoleon Bonaparte’s military campaign in Egypt, French scholars and artists who had accompanied the French army were creating detailed drawings and descriptions of the sites they encountered. In 1835, a French orientalist named Jean-François Champollion published a book that he called <i>Monuments de l’Egypte et de la Nubie</i> (“The Monuments of Egypt and Nubia”). This volume contained extensive descriptions and sketches of Egyptian monuments that the French encountered during their expedition. At Medinet Habu, Champollion extensively described the architecture and reliefs that he found there. In his book, there are dozens of pages dedicated exclusively to the sketches he made in his journal. However, the early French scholars in Egypt “contributed very little information on the architecture of Medinet Habu” (Hölscher, 1934) </p>

     </figure>
<p>In 1845, the Prussians arrived in Egypt. Carl Richard Lepsius, the man leading the expedition, created what archaeologists today regard as the first “useful” ground plan of the buildings at Medinet Habu. He conducted a series of informal excavations to uncover structures hidden underneath the sand, all while trying to explain what the buildings were used for and how they were related to each other (Hölscher, 1934). Lepsius, in association with his on-staff architect, published a book about the findings at Medinet Habu that they called <i>Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien</i> (“Monuments of Egypt and Ethiopia”). However, Lepsius has been accused of engaging in Antiquarian behaviors, such as bringing Egyptian artifacts back to Prussia/Germany. The Prussian expedition ended with the Franco-Prussian War and the founding of the <i>Service de Conservation des Monuments de l’Êgypte</i> by Auguste Mariette (Hölscher, 1934).</p>
<p>As 1888 rolled around, a man named Georges Daressy took over operations at Medinet Habu. Over the course of several years, a number of developments took place at the site.</p>

<blockquote>  - <b>1889:</b> A passage was made from the Eastern Fortified Gate to the Great Temple (about halfway across the site), the first courtyard of the temple was completely cleared, and the restoration of certain parts of the site began.
  <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
- <b>1891:</b> The second courtyard of Ramesses III’s temple was uncovered, revealing a Christian church dating to the Coptic period. These Coptic columns and other features were removed from the site altogether by Daressy and his team.
<br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
- <b>1892-1895:</b> The area east of the first pylon (of the great temple) was excavated.
<br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
- <b>1895-1896:</b> The Eastern Fortified Gate, as well as the rear part of the temple were completely uncovered.
<br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
- <b>1898-1899:</b> The exterior walls of the great temple were uncovered. </blockquote>
<br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
<p>What happened at Medinet Habu between 1888 and 1899 would not be familiar to us as modern archaeologists. These early scholars working at the site seemed to only be concerned with uncovering large stone structures and avoiding the features that they saw as “inferior” (brick buildings, small artifacts, etc.). Whenever they found anything that they did not see as being “important”, they stopped excavating that area and made no note about what they had found. Once Daressy and the Egyptian Service of Antiquities were satisfied, excavations ended and the site was left alone by scholars. <i>Sebakh</i>-diggers, civilians who were digging unofficially and taking artifacts for profit, descended upon Medinet Habu after the archaeologists had left. It is unknown how many artifacts were taken from the site, but some pieces have been found with antiquity dealers and private collectors (Hölscher, 1934). Numbers of papyri are also believed to have been taken, including a series of “late Ramessid documents concerning tomb robberies and the harem conspiracy against Ramesses III” (Hölscher, 1934).

</figure>
<p>Uvo Hölscher, a German archaeologist, was commissioned to survey Medinet Habu in the 1926/27 season by the Egyptian Service of Antiquites. He ended up working at Medinet Habu until the mid-1940s, publishing numerous volumes on his findings as new discoveries came to light. Under his careful observation, structures that had been previously ignored by earlier archaeologists were recorded and described in detail (Hölscher, 1934). Unlike his predecessors, Hölscher seemed genuinely interested in the smaller features and what they could tell us about how the site might have functioned on a daily basis. Most of the information that we have today about the architecture and components of Medinet Habu, as well as how it relates to similar sites in the area, came out of Uvo Hölscher’s expeditions in Egypt.</p>
<p>Since the 1950s, there are have been several epigraphic surveys and small-scale excavations conducted by scholars from all over the world. However, nothing “new” has been uncovered since Uvo Hölscher was there in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Instead, archaeologists and Egyptologists have chosen to analyze what has already been excavated (such as the reliefs on the walls) to try and build a comprehensive timeline of the site and the area around it. The Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago seems to have taken a special interest in Medinet Habu, as they conduct most of the epigraphic surveys of the site and most of Uvo Hölscher’s original works that have been translated into English can be found on their website.

     <h3>Conclusion</h3>

 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>While Medinet Habu may not be the biggest or most spectacular archaeological site in Thebes, we have been able to learn a lot from it. The facts are that this site is one of the best preserved and most informative New Kingdom sites that has been found in this area so far. From it, archaeologists and Egyptologists have been able to learn a lot about politics, religion, and society in ancient Egypt, as well as the importance of Thebes and the western desert in mortuary practices. Excavations at the site have also shown three major components -- the temple of Amun built by Hatshepsut and Thutmose III in the eighteenth dynasty, the giant mortuary temple of Ramesses III built in the 20th dynasty, and the later occupation by Christians in the Coptic period. If you take into account all of these components, you get an archaeological record that covers thousands of years of ancient Egyptian history. Medinet Habu is an extraordinary site that has given us a new understanding of history. It was a rare discovery, but one that has answered many questions and given a voice to an ancient civilization that has been gone for over 2,000 years.
