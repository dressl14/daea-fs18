      <h1>Hierakonpolis</h1>
      <h3>Early Dynastic</h3>
	  <h4>Caitlyn Danforth</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Hierakonpolis is an ancient settlement with several names and a cult center to the god Horus. In Greek the name for the site is known as Hierakonpolis which means “city of the Hawk or Falcon”, Nekhen is the name known to the Ancient Egyptians or in modern-day Arabic it is known as Kwam Al-Ahmar or Kom el-Ahmar which means “The Red Mound”. It is named this due to the red pottery sherds strewn across the entrance of the low desert, giving it the picture of a red landscape. This site is located in Upper Egypt, on the western bank of the Nile River (25°06’N, 32°46’E), north of Aswan and was one of early Egypt’s first capitals. It contains artifacts and sites that range from a number of time periods throughout Ancient Egypt's history, not limited to but including the late predynastic and early dynastic time periods. The site is associated with kingships and the formation of a unified Egyptian state.</p>
     <p>It is one of Egypt's most important archaeological sites, including very well preserved mud-brick structures, the Narmer Palette, tombs of royalty and a wide variety of fauna (introducing the idea of pet cemeteries), the earliest painted tomb and mortuary masks only known to be found at Nehken. The site is split into two separate zones. The first contains the remains of the town and the temple mound of Nekhen during the Dynastic period which is located at a low mound in the floodplain. The second zone is a group of interrelated sites about 3.5 kilometers (2+ miles) across the low desert and heading westward about 2 kilometers (about 1.5 miles) into the Wadi Desert. The zone represents one of the biggest Predynastic towns that are still accessible today. The ancient city has survived many time periods, starting from the Predynastic to the Ptolemaic Dynasty, political and environmental shifts within the nation. Through this, a reduction is seen from a national center to a provincial center and then to a ancestral shrine.</p>

<h3>Heirakonpolis as a City</h3>
<p>During its hay day, which would have been around 3700 B.C. - 3300 B.C. The largest growth of the city and population was in 3500B.C., it would have stretched 3 plus miles along the Nile River making it one of the largest urban centers in the Nile Valley. The city is classified as a regional center of power and a capital prior to the unification of Egypt. Starting from the high point of civilization we can track the population decline through the periods and why. During the Naqada I period (3100B.C.) the estimated population was about 10,000 inhabitants covering anywhere from 32 - 37 hectares of land. This is the only time that the habitation across the low desert would be seen. From Naqada IIIa-b (3500 - 3300 B.C.) we see a decline in population and movement into the floodplain due to the recession of the Nile floods as well as a return to the use of the cemetery at HK6. There is also population loss due to the formation and rise of the cities El-Kab (across the river) and Edfu (south of Nekhen).Through the unification period of Egypt, we see a slower decline of the city and the desert area is completely abandoned.</p>
<p>There is evidence of a revival of the city under Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III during the New kingdom but it is short lived. The city now lays dormant and hasnt been inhabited since the Bardarian period (4500 - 4200B.C.). Evidence of this is shown through coring excavation at the site much focus of the interpretations and excavation of the area date to the Predynastic and early dynastic periods.</p>

<h3>Issues with the Site</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that excavations were done by British archaeologists, J.E. Quibell, F.W. Green, J. Garstang, and H. Jones; they left information and context severely lacking. Only being able to draw from a preliminary report, letters back home and negatives which were used to piece together any reconstruction done in the area (Barta, M, 1997). The stratigraphy was done by Quibell and Green of the important sites located in Hierakonpolis were incoherent and many didn’t understand (Bussman, R, 2014). Among these issues, there is also a problem with looting of the graves and various sites across Nehken, as well as a damage to the land from modern farmers mining the area for organic-rich midden to fertilize their fields and the encroaching city to the right.</p>
<p>The site was filled with royal activity through the Middle Kingdom, however much of the knowledge gathered comes from archived field reports, manuscripts and objects, much of which are unpublished. During the shifts in the induction periods of the Nile River, we see shifts in elite cemeteries and population increase and decrease. For example, during Naqada IIc period we see the elite burials move to the southeastern side of the site and then again in Naqada III period we see them return to the wadi cemetery.</p>

<h3> Excavations</h3>
<p>Through the site, there are many finds which are singular to archaeological phenomena in Egypt as well as many firsts. Some of which are the oldest life-sized statues, earliest painted tomb (HK100), largest flint knives ever produced in Egypt, the oldest free-standing structure in the world, earliest temple, the first mummies, an elephant burial and more. Starting chronologically this next section will be about the excavations that took place at Hierakonpolis and the findings within them. According to record, the earliest excavation was in 1798 by Vivant Denon, a Napoleonic scholar. He discovered the Ptolemaic Temple, which was soon destroyed by the 1850’s. From 1897 - 1899, J.E. Quibell and F.W. Green excavated the temple and town area at Hierakonpolis, they discovered many finds throughout the years.</p>
<p>In 1898 the “Main Deposit” was discovered. It was buried under a temple and is presumed to be an early shrine with a cache of temple furnishings and votive offerings. These finds included the Narmer Palette (dated to 3150 B.C.) and macehead, the Scorpion macehead, a limestone statue of Pharaoh Khasekhemwy and stone vases with incised names of predynastic kings. During this period further excavation of locality HK33 was conducted, providing further evidence of a decorated tomb with paintings of boats dating back to the Naqada IIc period. The “Fort” complex was also excavated, dating back to the reign of Khasekhemwy. This is known because of a granite inscription found at the entrance of the Fort. It is located to the Northeast, at the mouth of the Wadi Abul Suffian, being a structure comprised of walls that would have been plastered white and decorated with paneling in its time.
The enclosure wall is protected by a lower wall and was built on a Predynastic/Early Dynastic cemetery. Simple graves of shallow, oval pits were found around the structure containing crouched bodies. The graves were found with vessels and a few other items inside. The cemetery could have been used by the neighboring towns for the graves show a middle to low social class.</p>
<p>1897-1898 two groups of finds by Quibell and Green were discovered in the temple area. The first group was a small group of copper statues of King Pep I and his son, Merenre. Several of the objects dates to the Middle Kingdom and the second intermediate period. The second group came from the temple and date to the first dynasty; while parts of limestone pillars found date from the fourth dynasty. In 1905-1906 Garstang and Jones resumed further excavation within the walls of the town. They had several goals in mind when beginning this project. They were to restrict the activity of tomb raiders going on in the area and held hope that they would continue to discover spectacular finds. They began their search in the unexcavated, Northwestern part of town, where they discovered several one-roomed houses dating to the third dynasty. Moving forward they re-excavated the “main deposit” finding more ceremonial objects and a fragment of the statue of Khaskehmwy. From there they discovered 188 tombs within the Fort complex. However, as mentioned in the earlier paragraph the information is dodgy to due to the lack of adequate records (Barta, M, 1997).</p>
<p>In 1967 minor excavations began by American archaeologists W.A. Fairservis and M.A. Hoffman that still continue to today. They started in a 10 meter wide, north to south running traverse digging 10 m squares. The goals of their excavation were to begin a thorough mapping of the area, document visible monuments (tombs of the second intermediate period and the New Kingdom), a reconstruction of the changes in climate, hydrological and geological environment of the site and adjacent areas. These excavations resulted in finding more ceremonial offerings, a copper harpoon, and a palace. In 1967-1969 and 1971-1981 both American archaeologist’s fieldwork of the archaic temple and town discovered statues of Senworset II, III, and Amenenhet III. A drilling survey in 1984 done by M.A. Hoffman discovered about 4 meters of deposits from human inhabitation. The earliest strata contained Badarian sherds. The west edge of the site, in the wadis, was the earliest occupation dating back to the Badarian and Naqada I period.</p>
<p>From 1997 to 2000 Barbara Adams explored several burial sites. She discover significant finds in mortuary items. She discovered the earliest example of an above gorund funerary sturcture over an elite tomb. The rectangular wooden posts (possibly cedar from Lebanon) suggested that the enclosure was 30 feet wide and 65 feet long. She also discovered funerary masks never seen before anywhere else. These clay masks were made to fit over the head attached by a piece of clothe through the ears. They had cut out eyes and mouth and molded ears and nose(Friedman, R.(2012)).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This site is important to the archaeology of Egypt because it was a site of many firsts. As well as giving insight into new ideas and formations of Egyptian tradition, like religious rituals. There are examples of early pre-mumifacation found in cemeteries of the working class. This site and its tombs display the amount of power a pharaonic king held during the time, as well as the first elites and the wealth of goods. We see this through the items that are buried within the tombs and the number of large, exotic and dangerous animals that are buried with the deceased as well. The number of deposits found through stratification also provide us with the evidence that this was a bustling city and a large industrial zone due to the production of beer and pottery goods that were mass produced. The change of time periods is a significant result due to the fact that many sites were built on top of each other and artifacts overlapped. Showing multiple uses and reuse of the land for inhabitation and religious means. Many artifacts are found dedicated to Horus, leaving the clear idea that this was a cult center to kings and religion.</p>
