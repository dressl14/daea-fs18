     <p>Deir el Ballas was a military base occupied by Thebian forces during the Second Intermediate period (ca. 1600-1500 BCE), during a time when the country was divided between the Thebians in the South and Hyksos in the North. It was occupied for about a hundred years before the conflict was resolved and the city became obsolete. It was later reoccupied during the 18th Dynasty and the later Roman occupation of Egypt, but neither of these later settlements garners much focus of the archaeological community in comparison to the original occupation. Deir el Ballas was originally excavated by the Phoebe A. Hearst Expedition of the University of California and Berkley from 1900-01, by George A. Reisner, A. M. Lythgoe, and F. W. Green. Unfortunately, the results of the excavation were never published, so the site was excavated again from 1980-86. Deir el Ballas still draws archaeological interest and continued excavations to this day (Lacovara, 2012, p. 1).</p>

 <p>Deir el Ballas lies just north of Thebes and approximately 20 km south of Dendara. It was purposefully and strategically situated along a bend on the west bank of the Nile River, so that the lookout guards had a clear view of any incoming ships and therefore had an advantage over invading Hyksos ships. With this bend, they would also be able to make a shortcut to the invading ships on food if need be. (Current World Archaeology, 2017, p. 11)</p>
 <p> Much of Deir el Ballas sits on desert ground. However, there are parts of the east site of the site that intersect with modern agricultural lands, the presence of which has halted the process of excavation in that area for the time being. The area is peppered with hills, among which is a naturally occurring crescent shaped outcropping of limestone cliffs. These cliffs, as well as some of the other hills, were included and integrated into the planning of the city (Current World Archaeology, 2017, p. 11).</p>

<h3>The Site Itself</h3>

 <p>Deir el Ballas was constructed parallel with the Nile, resulting in an oblong and rectangular city. It contains a palace, workmen's quarters, a lookout tower, and cemeteries. The palace, which is referred to by archaeologists as the North Palace, rests in the middle of the aforementioned outcropping of limestone cliffs and is surrounded to the north and south by residential buildings. It is made of large mud bricks (57 cm x 27 cm x 18 cm) and consists of several columned courts as well as a lengthy entrance hall, which was raised on top of a casemate platform. The architecture of the palace bares similarities to palaces built during the New Kingdom, which began after the occupation at Deir el Ballas had ended. Apart from the palace, there is a series of workmen's quarters, which were separated from the rest of the residential area by a series of flights of stairs cut into the hillside. The layout of the workmen's quarters resembles similar findings in Amarna (Current World Archaeology, 2017, p. 11).</p>
 <p>On the southern edge of the site stands the remains of a large, rectangular structure known as the South Palace. Despite its name, which was given early on in the archaeological process, this building is believed by today's archaeologists to have been a lookout post because it's structure is unlike any of the other residential buildings on site, and sits on the top of a hill, which would be ideal for getting the best view. The platform on top of the structure is about 40 m wide and 150 m long. Though none of them have survived, it is believed that this platform would have supported reed structure such as tents for those on duty. The building has sustained damage from looters, who knocked a triangular hole into the side of one of the exterior walls (Current World Archaeology, 2017, p. 11).</p>

 <h3>History of Excavation</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Deir el Ballas was originally excavated by the Phoebe A. Hearst Expedition of the University of California and Berkley from 1900-01, by George A. Reisner (who is better known for his work at Giza necropolis), A. M. Lythgoe, and F. W. Green. Unfortunately, Reisner never published his results, and the field notes he left behind were to brief to yield any useful information. In order to clarify Reisner's findings, the Museum of Boston sponsored a re-excavation the site from lead by Peter Lavovara in 1980, 1983, 1984, and 1986. This time, the results of the excavation were published in a Preliminary report by the American Research Center in Egypt. At the request of Mustafa Waziri at the Qena Inspectorate of Antiquities, the Ancient Egyptian Heritage and Archaeology Fund surveyed again from the 10th-24th of January 2017 in response to looting an other damages. As a part of their mission, this team photographed, mapped, and assessed planning for the continued preservation of the site (Larcova, 2017, 3-4). </p>

<p>Deir el Ballas was the earliest excavated royal city (Larcova, 2012, p. 1). In it, they found the earliest depiction of a horse ever found in Egypt (The Ancient Egyptian Heritage and Archaeology Fund, 2018, p. 1) It was also part Egypt's conflict wit the Hyksos. This conflict, which played out during the Second Intermediate Period (ca 1782- 1570 BCE), helped to drive Ancient Egypt toward more imperialist and empiric policies during the New Kingdom. In order to insure a more permanent victory over the Hyksos armies, Egypt turned its military might outward into neighboring countries and crush the Hyksos there as well. During the New Kingdom (which began when the Second Intermediate Period ended), Egypt continued this show of power against other countries, which, in some ways, cemented its place in ancient Mediterranean history. Deir el Ballas was not the site of any earth-shattering battles, but it was a part of this greater historical event.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Deir El Ballas was a well planned military and royal establishment that enjoyed a relitively short occupation in the grand scheme of Ancient Egyptian civilization. Despite its lack of longevity, this site may have played a crucial role in the war against the Hyksos. It stood at a turning point in Ancient Eyptian history as the Pharoahs adopted new techology, such as the horse, and used it to turn its influence outward and form an empire. It is a complete military city whose secrets have yet to be fully uncovered, and archaeologists and Egyptologists have excavated it multiple times since its discovery over a century ago. This interest has yet to be satisfied, and it is possible that we may see more excavations at Deir El Ballas in the future. It is also within reason that, concidering its connection to Egypt's conflict with the Hyksos that we may someday find an important piece of history that has yet to be uncovered at Deir El Ballas.</p>
